# Learning Idris

I'm currently working through [Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris) (use the code `fccbrady` for a sweet discount).

Don't use this repo as a reference. It will not be well structured, and I will frequently modify exercises to try out various things.
